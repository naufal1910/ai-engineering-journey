# üß† AI Engineering Journey ‚Äì 14 Week Hands-On Roadmap

Welcome to my self-paced, hands-on AI Engineering journey. This repository documents 14 weeks of real-world projects and skills development across machine learning, deep learning, NLP, model deployment, and MLOps.

## üöÄ Objective
Build core competencies in AI Engineering through consistent 30-minute daily projects that lead to a fully deployed portfolio by Week 14.

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- FastAPI, Streamlit, FAISS
- Git, GitHub, Docker (future)

## üìö Learning Approach
- Learn-by-doing
- Project-first, theory-later
- Daily 30-minute building blocks
- Open-source everything: tracked in GitHub

## üì¶ Deployment
Most projects are designed to be easily deployed to:
- Streamlit Cloud
- Hugging Face Spaces
- Render / Railway

## ‚ú® One-Time Setup (Python Virtual Environment)

To use a shared environment across all weeks:

### 1. Create Virtual Environment (Windows)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate It
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install All Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Tell VS Code to Use This Environment
- Open Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Select: **Python: Select Interpreter**
- Choose: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

### 5. (Optional) When You Add New Packages
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 6. Deactivate When Done
```bash
deactivate
```
